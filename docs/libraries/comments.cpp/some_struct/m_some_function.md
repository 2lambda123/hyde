        description:
          - This is a longer description of this function that does things as well as it does. Notice how long this comment is! So impressive. ðŸ’¥
        post: An example postcondition.
        pre: An example precondition.
        return: Some additional value.
        throw: "`std::runtime_error` if the function actually _can't_ do the thing. Sorry!"
        todo: This really could use some cleanup. Although, its implementation doesn't exist...
        warning: This function may be very expensive to run. Do not call it inside a loop.
      return: __OPTIONAL__
